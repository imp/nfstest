NFS Test Suite
==============
Provides a set of tools for testing either the NFS client or the NFS server,
included tests focused mainly on testing the client. These tools include the
following:

    Test utilities package (nfstest)
    ================================
    Provides a set of tools for testing either the NFS client or the NFS server,
    most of the functionality is focused mainly on testing the client.
    These tools include the following:

        - Process command line arguments
        - Provide functionality for PASS/FAIL
        - Provide test grouping functionality
        - Provide multiple client support
        - Logging mechanism
        - Debug info control
        - Mount/Unmount control
        - Create files/directories
        - Provide mechanism to start a packet trace
        - Provide mechanism to simulate a network partition
        - Support for pNFS testing


    Packet trace package (packet)
    =============================
    Testing NFS has mostly been done using test tools like connectathon test suite,
    filebench, iozone and others. But mostly using the connectathon test suite.
    These are good tools for testing, but they are outdated and they also cannot
    be used for testing pNFS thoroughly.

    For example, you can run the connectathon test suite on pNFS, it runs, it passes
    all the tests -- but how can we make sure that pNFS worked properly. How can we
    verify that a layout is granted, but not only that a layout is granted, what
    type of layout was granted (read, rw). Did the client sent IO to the data
    servers or to the metadata server.

    The Packet trace module takes a trace file created by tcpdump and unpacks
    the contents of each packet. You can decode one packet at a time, or do a
    search for specific packets. The main difference between this modules and
    other tools used to decode trace files is that you can use this module to
    completely automate your tests.

    How does it work? It opens the trace file and reads one record at a time
    keeping track where each record starts. This way, very large trace files
    can be opened without having to wait for the file to load and avoid loading
    the whole file into memory.

    Packet layers supported:
        - Ethernet II (RFC 894)
        - IP layer (supports v4 only)
        - TCP layer
        - RPC layer
        - NFS v4.0
        - NFS v4.1 including pNFS file layouts


Requirements and limitations
============================
In order to run the included tests, the user id in all the client hosts must
have access to run commands as root using the 'sudo' command without the need
for a password, this includes the host where the test is being executed.
This is used to run commands like 'mount' and 'umount'. Furthermore, the
user id must be able to ssh to remote hosts without the need for a password
if test requires the use of multiple clients.

Network partition is simulated by the use of 'iptables', please be advised
that after every test is run the iptables is flushed and reset so any rules
previously setup will be lost. Currently, there is no mechanism to restore
the iptables rules to their original state.

Tests
=====
    nfstest_cache - NFS client side caching tests
    =============================================
    Verify consistency of attribute caching by varying acregmin, acregmax,
    acdirmin, acdirmax and actimo. Verify consistency of data caching by varying
    acregmin, acregmax, acdirmin, acdirmax and actimo.

    Valid for any version of NFS


    nfstest_delegation - Delegation tests
    =====================================
    Basic delegation tests verify that a correct delegation is granted when
    opening a file for reading or writing. Also, another OPEN should not be
    sent for the same file when the client is holding a delegation. Verify
    that the stateid of all I/O operations should be the delegation stateid.
    Reads from a different process on the same file should not cause the client
    to send additional READ packets when the client is holding a read delegation.
    Furthermore, a LOCK packet should not be sent to the server when the client
    is holding a delegation.

    Recall delegation tests verify the delegation is recalled when a conflicting
    operation is sent to the server from a different client. Conflicting operations
    are reading, writing and changing the permissions on the same file. Note, that
    reading a file from a different client can only recall a read delegation.
    Also, verify that a delegation is not recalled when a different client is
    granted a read delegation. After a delegation is recalled, the client should
    send an OPEN with CLAIM_DELEGATE_CUR before returning the delegation and the
    stateid should be the same as the original OPEN stateid. Also, a delegation
    should not be granted when re-opening the file right before returning
    the delegation. Verify client flushes all written data before returning
    the WRITE delegation. The LOCK should be sent as well right before returning
    a delegation which has been recalled. A delegation should not be granted
    on the second client who cause the delegation recall on the first client.

    Valid for any version of NFS granting delegations


    nfstest_dio - Direct I/O tests
    ==============================
    Functional direct I/O tests verify that every READ/WRITE is sent to the server
    instead of the client caching the requests. Client bypasses read ahead by
    sending the READ with only the requested bytes. Verify the client correctly
    handles eof marker when reading the whole file. Verify client ignores delegation
    while writing a file.

    Direct I/O on pNFS tests verify the client sends the READ/WRITE to the correct
    DS or the MDS if using a PAGESIZE aligned buffer or not, respectively.

    Direct I/O data correctness tests verify that a file written with buffered I/O
    is read correctly with direct I/O. Verify that a file written with direct I/O
    is read correctly with buffered I/O.

    Vectored I/O tests verify coalescence of multiple vectors into one READ/WRITE
    packet when all vectors are PAGESIZE aligned. Vectors with different alignments
    are sent on separate packets.

    Valid for NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1 including pNFS


    nfstest_pnfs - Basic pNFS functional tests
    ==========================================
    Verify basic pNFS functionality for file (both READ and WRITE), including
    opening a second file within the same mount and having a lock on the file.
    Also, verify basic pNFS functionality for a file opened for both READ and
    WRITE while reading the file first and then writing to it or the other way
    around by writing to the file fist and then reading the file. These tests
    verify proper functionality of pNFS and NFSv4.1 as well:

        - Verify EXCHANGE_ID is sent to MDS
        - Verify CREATE_SESSION is sent to MDS
        - Verify LAYOUTGET is sent to MDS (check layout type, iomode, layout range)
        - Verify GETDEVICEINFO is sent to MDS
        - Verify EXCHANGE_ID is sent to the correct DS
        - Verify CREATE_SESSION is sent to DS
        - Verify READ/WRITE is sent to DS (check correct stateid, correct offset and size)
        - Verify no GETATTR is sent to DS

    Only valid using NFSv4.1 with pNFS enabled and file layout type


    nfstest_posix - POSIX file system level access tests
    ====================================================
    Verify POSIX file system level access over the specified path using
    positive and negative testing.

    Valid for any version of NFS


Installation
============
1. Install package using one of the following methods:
   a. Install the rpm as root:
      # rpm -i NFStest-1.0.1-1.noarch.rpm

      All manual pages are available
      $ man nfstest

      Run tests:
      $ nfstest_pnfs --help

   b. Untar the tarball:
      $ cd ~
      $ tar -zxvf NFStest-1.0.1.tar.gz

      The tests can run without installation, just set the python path
      environment variable:
      $ export PYTHONPATH=~/NFStest-1.0.1
      $ cd NFStest-1.0.1/test
      $ ./nfstest_pnfs --help

      Or install to standard python site-packages and executable directories:
      $ cd ~/NFStest-1.0.1
      $ sudo python setup.py install

      All manual pages are available
      $ man nfstest

      Run tests:
      $ nfstest_pnfs --help

   c. Clone the git repository:
      $ cd ~
      $ git clone git://git.linux-nfs.org/projects/mora/nfstest.git

      The tests can run without installation, just set the python path
      environment variable:
      $ export PYTHONPATH=~/nfstest
      $ cd nfstest/test
      $ ./nfstest_pnfs --help

      Or install to standard python site-packages and executable directories:

      All manual pages are available
      $ man nfstest

      Run tests:
      $ nfstest_pnfs --help

2. Make sure user running the tests can run commands using 'sudo' without
   the need for a password.

3. Make sure user running the tests can run commands remotely using 'ssh'
   without the need for a password. This is only needed for tests which
   require multiple clients.

4. Create the mount point specified by the --mtpoint (default: /mnt/t) option
   on all the clients.
   $ sudo mkdir /mnt/t
   $ sudo chmod 777 /mnt/t


Run the tests
=============
   The only required option is --server
   $ nfstest_pnfs --server 192.168.0.11

   Required options are --server and --client
   $ nfstest_cache --server 192.168.0.11 --client 192.168.0.20

   Testing with different values of --acmin and --acmax (this takes a long time)
   $ nfstest_cache --server 192.168.0.11 --client 192.168.0.20 --acmin 10,20 --acmax 20,30,60,80

   The only required option is --server but only the basic delegation tests will
   be run. In order to run the recall tests the --client option must be used
   $ nfstest_delegation --server 192.168.0.11 --client 192.168.0.20

   The only required option is --server
   $ nfstest_dio --server 192.168.0.11

   The only required option is --server
   $ nfstest_posix --server 192.168.0.11


Useful options
==============
--help
   All tests have this option to display usage information and options available

--createlog
   Create log file when specified

--keeptraces
   Do not remove any trace files at the end of execution

--verbose <none|opts|info|debug|all|intbitmask>
   Verbose level for info/debug messages

   Example:
       $ nfstest_posix --server 192.168.0.11 --verbose all
       $ nfstest_posix --server 192.168.0.11 --verbose 0x0F

--runtest <[^]testname1[,testname2[,...]]>
   Comma separated list of tests to run, if the first character on the list
   is '^' then run all the tests except the ones listed.

   Example:
       Run only the access, chdir, creat and fcntl tests
       $ nfstest_posix --server 192.168.0.11 --runtest access,chdir,creat,fcntl

       Run all the tests except for open and chmod
       $ nfstest_posix --server 192.168.0.11 --runtest ^open,chmod

--tverbose <group|normal|verbose>
   Verbose level for test messages (default: normal)
   When tverbose=group, only the test groups are displayed as PASS if all the
   tests in the group passed, otherwise it will FAIL. In some of the tests
   tverbose could be 'verbose' for a greater level of verbosity in which a
   particular test have many sub-tests (>100)

   Example:
       $ nfstest_posix --server 192.168.0.11
       *** Verify POSIX API access() on NFSv4
           PASS: access - file access allowed with mode F_OK
           PASS: access - file access not allowed with mode F_OK for a non-existent file
           PASS: access - file access allowed with mode R_OK for file with permissions 0777
           PASS: access - file access allowed with mode W_OK for file with permissions 0777
           PASS: access - file access allowed with mode X_OK for file with permissions 0777
           ...

       $ nfstest_posix --server 192.168.0.11 --tverbose group
           PASS: Verify POSIX API access() on NFSv4 (58 passed, 0 failed)

--bugmsgs <filename>
   File containing test messages to mark as bugs if they failed. When at least
   one of the tests fails the exit code is set to 1. When this option is
   specified, all known bugs are not counted as failures so the whole test
   execution is not failed. If the known bugs actually passed, using this
   option will fail the test to let the user know that the bug has been fixed.

--ignore
   Ignore all bugs given by bugmsgs. If this option is specified all failures
   given by bugmsgs are ignored. On the other hand, if a test passes which is
   marked as a bug, using this option the test will not failed as when using
   the bugmsgs option alone.

--nfsdebug <flags>
   Set NFS kernel debug flags and save log messages. Use any of the valid flags
   given for module 'nfs' on command 'rpcdebug'.

--rpcdebug <flags>
   Set RPC kernel debug flags and save log messages. Use any of the valid flags
   given for module 'rpc' on command 'rpcdebug'.
